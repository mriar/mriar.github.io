    <p>Cloud storage is a crowded market with big name brands like Google & Dropbox. These companies offer not enough storage space for users and are targeted to businesses rather than people. There is room for a niche service that provides users
      with targeted features that help them organize their personal files.</p>

      <p>From my research, I learned that 75% of users prefer desktop version over mobile so I focused my efforts on a desktop cloud storage platform. I also learned that Google & Dropbox both use a list & thumbnail tile views so I tested that out
        with my sketches & wireframes.</p>

  <section class="branding">
    <article class="branding-text">
      <h2>Branding</h2>
      <p>I learned a couple of things from my research, I learned that Google and Dropbox both use lighter colors for their user interfaces & this was validated with my survey where I found that 62% of users use cloud storage during the day. From
        this, it was clear to me that my branding would consist of lighter colors rather than a dark theme.</p>
    </article>
    <article class="logo">
      <h2>Logo Design</h2>
      <p>CloudFul is targeted for personal use, not for business. This meant staying clear from a professional and dull look. CloudFul makes cloud storage fun with its playful and colorful vibe. The colors are fun and relaxing for the user. The name
        CloudFul incorporated the playful and colorfulness of the brand. The colors used in the brand aren’t bright or jarring but very subtle and calm.</p>

    </article>
    <article class="colors">
      <h2>Color Palette</h2>
      <p>The brand colors were selected based on creating a simple and calm user experience that set the tone for feeling secure and loyal. The color blue was used throughout the cloud storage website to make users feel safe with their file storage.
        Blue is also in the the dark text color.</p>

    <article class="fonts">
      <h2>Fonts</h2>
      <p>Fonts were chosen based on readablilty and friendliness. Roboto is a sans-serif typeface. It has a geometric feel but has open and friendly curves. Karla is a quirky and fun sans-serif font. It has a more natural feeling.</p>

  <!-- User Testing Round 2-->

  <section class="tests2">
    <article class="ab-tests">
      <h2>A&B Testing</h2>
      <p>Once branding was finalized I created high-fidelity mockups. I tested these mockups with 47 users using Usability Hub preference testing.</p>

      <h4>Key Feedback from Testing</h4>
      <p>From the testing it was clear that I needed to make a few changes.</p>
      <ul class="list-feedback">
        <li class="dashed-list">The color was too feminine for users.</li>
        <li class="dashed-list">The sign in screen for returning users was actually the create account form so I needed to fix that issue.</li>
        <li class="dashed-list">The scroll function needed to be fixed for the homepage layout since users couldn't tell that they can scroll further down.</li>
        <li class="dashed-list">The buttons did not match the brand style guidelines. They needed to be more consistent with branding.</li>
      </ul>

  <!-- Conclusion-->

  <article class="conclusion">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The cloud storage industry is growing as more technology integrates it automatically with devices. I expected there not to be a need for another cloud storage site a first but through my research I found that the amount of space users are
      given is low and they mostly use it for personal use. It was surprising to see most cloud storage platforms targeting business user than personal.</p>
    <p>CloudFul is a good solution to the problems presented in this case study. The features I included in this prototype were the most important to users and were great for the MVP. Although, if I had more time I would include organization tools
      that help tag and categorize files.</p>
