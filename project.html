        <h2>Fonts</h2>
        <p class="font-text">Fonts were chosen based on readablilty and friendliness. Roboto is a sans-serif typeface. It has a geometric feel but has open and friendly curves. Karla is a quirky and fun sans-serif font. It has a more natural feeling.

          <li class="dashed-list">The color was too feminine for users.</li>
          <li class="dashed-list">The sign in screen for returning users was actually the create account form.</li>
          <li class="dashed-list">The scroll function needed to be fixed for the homepage layout. Users couldn't figure out how to scroll further down.</li>
          <li class="dashed-list">The buttons did not match the brand style guidelines. They needed to be more consistent with branding.</li>

    <!-- Conclusion-->

    <article class="conclusion">
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p class="conclusion">The cloud storage industry is growing as more technology integrates it automatically with devices. At first, I expected there to be no need for another cloud storage service. But, through my research I found the
        amount
        of space users are
        given is low and they mostly use it for personal use. It was surprising to see most cloud storage services targeting business users rather than personal.</p>
      <p class="conclusion-text">CloudFul is a good solution to the problems presented in this case study. The features I included in this prototype were the most important to users and were great for the MVP. Although, if I had more time I would
        include organization tools
        to help tag and categorize files.</p>
