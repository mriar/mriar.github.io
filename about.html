          <h3>Discovering Design</h3>
          <p class="discovering-design-text">My passion for user experience design started when I was a Junior in college studying communications. My professor shared with us the ability to empower people to do things they have never done before
            using
            technology. She shared a story about a mechanic who owned a car shop. When he couldn't afford the costs of operating the place a customer started a GoFundMe page, this helped him stay in business. At this point, I had no idea what user
            experience was, just the psychology behind it.</p>
          <p class="discovering-design-text">It wasn't until I was in graduate school studying business when I started to apply some design principles to my projects. In business school, I was expected to identify a problem and the customer needs.
            Those needs were validated through customer research coducted via surveys and interviews. I was making minimal viable products for each solution and testing them. What I was practicing in business school was user research & basic design.
            I
            had the opportunity to iterate on different business ideas through user testing and design.</p>

          <h3>My Motivation to Design</h3>
          <p class="design-motivation-text">If user interfaces are made easy and simple to use then, people all around the world with different educational backgrounds and socio-ethnic groups can solve their problems using technology.</p>
          <p class="design-motivation-text">I have experienced this firsthand, My dad lives in Punjab, a rural agricultural region in India. I visited him for the first time this year since his deportation in 2009. It was an emotional reunion but
            without his smartphone, he wouldn't have been able to keep in touch all these years. 2 years ago, my dad purchased a Samsung Galaxy S5. I saw my dad for the first time(over a WhatsApp call) in 2017 (8 years later). I was amazed at how
            easily my dad, who hasn't used a computer was able to figure out how to download WhatsApp and use it to call his family.</p>
          <p class="design-motivation-text">Design is important to me because it has impacted me directly. Seeing my parents use it to communicate with their family is such a happy and emotional experience. I deeply understand how people all over the
            world meet their needs through different technologies, social platforms, and applications. Having a smooth user experience makes it so much better for users. Understanding their needs is super important and valuable for the product
            offering. UX is important.</p>

        <article class="choosing-design">
          <h3>Choosing UX Design</h3>
          <p class="choosing-design-text">I chose to pursue user experience design because of my personal and professional experiences. The parts I enjoyed the most from school and work were the ones where I got to research and show my creative drive
            to solve problems. From learning about human-computer interaction to designing lookbooks for vendors at Zulily. It all came together as each journey led me to design.</p>
