      <p class="summary-text">Over the course of my internship, I worked on designing an augmented reality(AR) social experience IOS app. What does social experience mean? The best way to describe this app is by comparing it to Airbnb Experiences. Airbnb Experiences provides local guided experiences to travelers all around the world. This client project utilized augmented reality to engage the users through guided experiences. The user can discover adventures, create experiences for others, and adventure together with friends.</p>

      <h2>User Testing</h2>
      <p class="user-test2-text">19 users were tested using maze testing & there were 2 in-person testers. The usability score this time was much higher on maze! We got an 81 which is better than 31 from the wireframe testing. All users completed the
        tasks smoothly and successfully. The feedback was positive and the users related
        to the brand being earthy with the logo and branding of the site.

      <p class="user-test2-text">Users loved the prototype. Feedback from users included the following comments.</p>
      <p class="user-test2-text"> "Seems very easy to use and love the colors you're using!"</p>
      <p class="user-test2-text">"Nice job - no issues completing any of the mazes :)"</p>

      <p class="user-test2-text">"Looking good! Checkout process was easy and what I'm used to"</p>
      <p class="user-test2-text">"Very clean, easy to use, follows the e-commerce platform I see pretty consistently across many product pages."</p>
      <p class="user-test2-text">"For the dropdown filter, probably add "price" to high to low and change "relevancy" to “relevance"</p>
      <p class="user-test2-text">"Pretty straightforward"
      </p>
      <ul class="list-feedback">
        <li class="dashed-list">Wording is off on a few text items like sort by menu uses the word relevancy instead of relevance.</li>
        <li class="dashed-list">Read more button is far from details section on product detail page.</li>
        <li class="dashed-list">Thumbnail images are small for landing page.</li>
        <li class="dashed-list">The 15% off deal on the navigation bar doesn't stand out.</li>

  <article class="iterations">
    <h2>Final Iteration</h2>
    <p class="iteration-text">After user testing was complete iterations were made to the prototype. The free shipping deal was highlighted to show users there is a sale. Thumbnail images were made bigger for more visibility & the brand colors were
      highlighted and used more on the landing page. The text errors were fixed and the page headings for “Top Rated”, “Under 25”, & “About Us” were brought into the green box to avoid eyes from bouncing around the page.</p>

  <!-- Conclusion-->

  <article class="conclusion">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="conclusion">Rooty is an easy to use e-commerce website for green products. Today on the market there is no website dedicated to providing top quality products that are eco-friendly to customers. Users have to go out of their way to
      discover products. This is not only a good business opportunity but also a design that focuses on pre-existing checkout process standards and search features to build a solid user experience. It was surprising to see websites like Wonderful
      Things not focusing in on the search feature. I found that users will use the search bar more often than not. If I had more time I would build out a better and more robust search function for this website. This project overall was exciting
      because the environment is something I feel really passionate about and I am always looking for ways to take part in caring for it.
